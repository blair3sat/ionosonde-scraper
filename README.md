# ionosonde-scraper
A web scraper to get FTP file paths from https://www.ukssdc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/digisondes/cost_database.pl with Nodejs (because Python glitches out on some of them), write those to a filesystem, then (using Ryan's Python pandas thing) convert to CSV.

> WARNING: This is now useless, as we have the link to the FTP server.
